# Development Approach for the Advent of Code Automation Project

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to build an end-to-end solution for solving Advent of Code challenges using **AI-assisted development**, primarily with **Aider Chat**. The project will follow an iterative, test-driven approach, ensuring high-quality, maintainable, and open-source-friendly code.

---

## Development Workflow

1. **Task Breakdown and Planning**  
   - Define clear, incremental tasks with specific goals and test criteria.  
   - Document tasks in a structured format for tracking progress.  

2. **AI-Assisted Development**  
   - Use **Aider Chat** to assist with:  
     - Code generation.  
     - Code improvements and refactoring.  
     - Explanations and optimizations.  
   - Utilize **DeepSeek R1** for architecture and planning.  
   - Use **DeepSeek V3** for implementation and debugging.

3. **Incremental Development Steps**  
   - Define the task.  
   - Generate an initial implementation with AI.  
   - Review and refine the AI-generated code.  
   - Implement and run tests.  
   - Accept or request further modifications.  

4. **Testing and Validation**  
   - Ensure functional correctness with automated tests.  
   - Validate edge cases and expected behaviors.  
   - Use Python testing frameworks for verification.

5. **Code Review and Documentation**  
   - Regularly review AI-generated code for improvements.  
   - Maintain clear and concise documentation for contributors.  

6. **Version Control and CI/CD**  
   - Use GitHub for source control and collaboration.  
   - Set up automated tests to ensure code quality.  

---

## Tools and Technologies

- **AI Tools:** Aider Chat (DeepSeek R1, DeepSeek V3)  
- **Programming:** Python, Requests, BeautifulSoup  
- **Version Control:** GitHub  
- **Testing:** Pytest  
- **Documentation:** Markdown  

---

## Best Practices

- Develop incrementally with clear milestones.  
- Use test-driven development to validate progress.  
- Review AI-generated code critically before acceptance.  
- Keep the project structure clean and maintainable.  
- Engage with the open-source community for feedback.  

---

## Next Steps

1. Set up the GitHub repository.  
2. Define initial tasks for project setup and authentication.  
3. Begin AI-assisted implementation and testing.

## First phase generated tasks
These tasks were generated by OpenAI O1 model with prompting it to follow my output rules and trying to focus on the making 
smaller tasks which is about a junior developer or medior developer level. I don't really modify anything in this and these 
tasks will be my main step list to implement the solution with Aider.chat and with the selected models. 

Each step will follow the following general development flow:
1. feed the task to with aider
2. check the diff it is created
3. i hope i will normally accept it but maybe give it suggestions to create
4. test the output of the code and if further improvement is needed i will add intermediate TASK to Aider to implement that extension

### AIDER config
I added a CONVENTIONS.md file which is configured globally for myself as a general READ input for Aider.

Than I added an .aiderignore file to the project to skip aider using every unnecessary files in the project.

I have upgraded Aider to v.0.72.3 as an actual version in which R1 models are supperted already.

To start AIDER with DeepSeek R1 as architect and DeepSeek V3 as editor model I start aider with
```
aider --architect --model r1 --editor-model deepseek
```

possible improvements:
- aider can automatically always call tests (lint, test run, etc.) so basic problems can be corrected immediately
- i hope the whole solution won't be big but if needed i have to make Aider to make the code to smaller parts and files
- i hope the whole solution won't be big but if it will be i have to think about possible improvements how to add more detail and context to the TASKs
- this whole task list is a good approach to solve the problem but it is pure AI output (my original thougths are included but almost one-shot output of OpenAI O1 model). So I am sure I have to add more intermediate or post TASKs to solve my original goal.


From now on these are the tasks I get as a starting output:

I won't say i write about every step i create cause it requires a lot of time from me to document everything. So I will write only the most important parts here.
After I have started the Aider with the command i provided above i get into the architect mode and i could see that Ader already use my CONVENTIONS.md.

Now I will start adding the new tasks to it...

## TASK 1
was success but have to solve some issues
- have to modify the toml file to be sync with my account (OK)
- i updated the toml python and uv version (python 3.12 and uv 0.5.24) (OK)
- i updated my UV (was not necessary but i felt like i should) (OK)
- i have to deleted the lockfile part from the toml file cause it cannot be parsed (WARN)

ERRORS:
- it said i have to do this but it doesn't created the venv for me so i have to created it myself with uv
1. Activate the virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
2. Install any dependencies: `uv pip install -r requirements.in`
3. Make initial commit: `git add . && git commit -m "Initial project setup"`
- maybe init the project with uv directly and add the modifications after that would be better (uv init + than use the outputs)
- after i init the project myself i could run the commands above and now i am sync and finished with the first TASK

## TASK 2
was success but cause i already have a README.md file at some part of the requirements were already there it case small problems to it.

ERRORS:
- it used classic python and not UV (I think the main problem is that uv is still quite new and most of the training codes use the classical solutions and that is soo strong that the model easily change back to it)
